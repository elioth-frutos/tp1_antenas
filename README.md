# About
This is a small school project, it is a program solves an algorithmic
problem involving matrix traversal.

## Building the program
1. Clone this repo.

```
git clone 
```

2. `cd` into the root directory and run `make`.

```
cd tp1_antenas
make
```

## Running the program.
After building it, run `./main` from the project root.

## Usage
*Warning*: the definition of the matrix "antenas" should go in the main function, NOT in the "antenas.h" header file.
The file "antenas.h", that describes the configuration of the grid, goes in the src directory. A sample file was made available.
```
username@hostname:~/tp1_antenas$ ./main
